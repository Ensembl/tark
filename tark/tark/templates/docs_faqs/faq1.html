<h4 id="tark_summary">What is Tark?</h4>
<p>
    Tark stands for Transcript ARchive. The goal of Tark is to create an archive of all transcript
    sequences from Ensembl and other sources, including historical gene sets. To ensure robust
    tracking of exact changes between gene and transcript sets, <a href="#tark_checksum">checksums</a>
    are included at a fine grained level.
