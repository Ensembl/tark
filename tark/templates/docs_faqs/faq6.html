<h4 id="tark_checksum">What do you mean by Checksum? How is it derived?</h4>
<p>A checksum is a small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data. The actual procedure
    which yields the checksum from a data input is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm,
    which usually output a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input.
